# COP3402-HW4
This projects authors are Brannon Shelnutt and Shawn Sherman.

Our project compiles and seems to output correctly, however in the case of the logicexample.txt testcase we recieve a error of "corrupted size vs. prev_size Aborted (core dumped). We were unable to figure out this error however the output for both testcases matches the given output.
